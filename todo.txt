Thoughts:
- Make a "render line":
  Solution to the proper rendering of multiple windows drawn on top of eachother (when deleting or moving a window around).
  We can have a list of all the windows rendered up to that point.
  We then find all the windows that are occluded by our current one and pick the one that appears first in the list.
  After that we render every window down the list, starting from the window picked before.
  Optimization ideas: Use a graph strucure so the list is the graph sorted topologically.
